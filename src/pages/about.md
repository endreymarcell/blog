## About Marca

My name is Marcell Endrey. My friends and family call me Marca.

I have spent 7 years at Prezi in different engineering roles.
Currently I'm working at Wise as a senior frontend developer.

I think a lot about how to best approach software engineering.
[This collection of quotes](/quotes) should give you an idea of what resonates with me.

## About Naming Things

I started this blog to share my professional opinion on a number of topics related to software engineering in the hope
of helping others with less experience or a different background.

The blog is currently built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), and deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
