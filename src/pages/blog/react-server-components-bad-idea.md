I'm so fond of this particular line from [the Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) that I'm listing it on [my Quotes page](/quotes) as well.

Ever since React Server Components came out, I see article after article, video after video trying to explain them.
Understanding RSC, Making sense of RSC, Demystifying RSC, RSC from scratch, RSC in under seven minutes, Deep dive into RSC...
It feels like poor Dan Abramov's full-time job in hist last year was trying to explain RSC again and again.

You know what this reminds me of? Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript.
I read about it in all the JavaScript books again and again,
and each author ensured me that although prototypal inheritance might feel odd at first if you're used to other languages,
but once you understand it, it's actually a very powerful mechanism, maybe even better than class-based inheritance.

All that has achieved was make me feel dumb.

But then ES6 rolled around and boom, suddenly you really don't need to care about all that stuff.
So maybe it wasn't all that important or powerful after all?
Better yet â€” who cares if it's super powerful if nobody can understand the bloody thing?
