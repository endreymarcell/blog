This page contains a list of quotes I am fond of. They should give you a good idea of how I like to approach my work.

<div id="quotes">

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.

I named my blog based on this quip that Phil Karlton was [throwing around while working on Netscape](https://www.karlton.org/2017/12/naming-things-hard).
There are also a number of [derivatives](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html), as well as statements in the same spirit ("[Readability counts](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)", "[Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6086714-programs-are-meant-to-be-read-by-humans-and-only)", "[Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler)" etc.)

> If I had more time I would’ve written a shorter letter.

Attributed to a number of people including Cicero, Mark Twain, Blaise Pascal, and more, this clever little phrase resonates with how I feel about efficient communication.

> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

Although I have some reservations about Python, its design philosophy is still near and dear to my heart, and I agree with many of the points from [The Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) by Tim Peters - this one is just one example.

> Given unlimited resources and unlimited schedule, great engineers will produce exactly nothing.

I'm quoting this from [Wayne Hale's blog](https://waynehale.wordpress.com/2012/10/07/after-ten-years-the-tyranny-of-requirements/) although he himself refers to it as "an old adage".

> Culture eats strategy for breakfast.

By Peter Drucker.
Caveat: it might get a stomach ache.

> Red lines are better than green lines.

I'm going to credit [Ákos Hochrein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akoshochrein/) with this one who often said this referring to change request diffs.

> This is so untrue that even its opposite is untrue.

Meaning that the statement is not simply false but a gross oversimplification of the topic, so it couldn't even be
simply true or false. This one comes from my mom.

> If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room.

General wisdom.
