## About Marca
My name is Marcell Endrey. My friends and family call me Marca.

I have spent 7 years at Prezi and currently I'm working at Wise as a senior frontend developer.
If you want to know more about me, head over to my personal site at [https://endreymarcell.hu](endreymarcell.hu).

## About Naming Things
I started this blog to share my professional opinion on a number of topics related to software engineering in the hope
of helping others with less experience or a different background.
